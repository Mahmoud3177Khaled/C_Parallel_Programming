From time_test_screenshot_1 and 2 we conclude that:
While MPI_Bcast and MPI_Reduce are collective operations used to make communication more effiecent, their advantage seems to be only visible in highly communicated overhead or large distributed systems.
But in our example here (prime count from 1 to 10,000,000), local process wise computation is heavy and communicated data is small... so, the variation in execution time between manual Send/Recv loops (27.356s) and Bcast/Reduce (27.656s) was negligible (maybe even a little worse) â€” nearly 0.3 seconds.
 This shows that for computationally intensive problems with little communications needed between processes, it matters little whether collective or manual communications are used.
